# üåü Microsoft MCP Servers


## üìò What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). It allows AI applications to connect with various data sources and tools in a consistent manner, enhancing their capabilities and flexibility. MCP follows a client-server architecture:

- **MCP Hosts**: Applications like AI assistants or IDEs that initiate connections.
- **MCP Clients**: Connectors within the host application that maintain 1:1 connections with servers.
- **MCP Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities through the standardized MCP.

For more details, visit the [official MCP website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
